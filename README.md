## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I spent a lot of time debugging my css to figure out why my flex container was not functioning as expected. In the end I found a solution that worked after trial and error. I tried hard to debug the code on my own without external sources and think I did a pretty good job!

### Continued development

I think it took me longer to figure this out than it needed to, this is just due to inexperience with CSS properties.

I would like to research Flexbox and Grid more so I can reduce the ammount of time it takes me to configure responsive containers.
